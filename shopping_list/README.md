# shopping_list

This project will get an item from user in Form and add it to the existing list of
grocery items.

## Getting Started

ListView is a scrollable list of widgets.

ListTile is a pre-designed row layout that typically includes:
    A title
    A subtitle
    Leading icon (like an avatar)
    Trailing icon or text (like an arrow)
    OnTap action

Key Learnings:
    - Learnt about Form widget. In that I learned how to connect Formkey to Form widget which is a global key ,then used this key to trigger validation, the save method to store the entered values in variables

and how you can therefore, use this form widget combined

with other special form field widgets

to conveniently manage possibly more complex forms

and form input combinations.

Adding validation

and showing error messages is a breeze as you learned.

And getting hold

of the entered values also is really straightforward

and therefore, you might wanna consider using form,

especially if you are building more complex user interfaces.
